concept for mandatory part:

	-scale up x and y by 100x, z by 20-40x
	-simulate u and v calculations
	-get min/max u and min/max v to get ratio
	-resize new u/v map and center it
^done

concept for bonus:
	-rotations and colors
	-changing z scale
	-rotation in x, y and z axis (always around point 0, 0)


todo :
implement gradient
find the best way to do rotations (destroy current img and make a new one ? wipe out current img and draw over it ?)
implement auto coloring if no colors provided. Colors would be based on Z value and multiple sets of colors available (would be swappable using keys)
