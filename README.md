# fdf

42 Project

Code can be optimized a lot, i parse the map too many times for no reason.

## how to use

do 
```
make
```
then
```
./fdf test_maps/t2.fdf
```
or any map you wish, there are some test maps in the test_maps folder.

You are not supposed to check map input on this project so assume undefined behaviour if you give a shit map to the program
